# DevDrift

Welcome to the DevDrift organization on GitHub! We are a team of developers passionate about creating various integrations for games. Our primary focus is to enhance the gaming experience by developing tools and features that streamline tournament participation, viewer engagement, and live streaming. Whether you're a game developer, tournament organizer, or a streamer, our solutions aim to make your gaming journey more enjoyable and efficient.

## About Us

At DevDrift, we specialize in building integrations that bring added functionality to games. Here are some key areas we focus on:

- **Game Overlays**: We develop overlays specifically designed for tournaments. These overlays provide real-time information, scores, and statistics, enhancing the viewing experience for both participants and spectators.

- **Tournament Automation**: Our team creates bots that automate the registration process for tournaments. These bots handle tasks such as gathering participant information, managing team formations, and communicating important updates to registered players.

- **Viewer Engagement**: We develop tools and features to facilitate interaction between streamers and their viewers. This includes chat bots that respond to viewer commands, follower notifications, and other interactive elements to create an engaging streaming experience.

- **Live Streaming**: We provide solutions to optimize the live streaming experience. From configuring streaming setups to integrating custom overlays, we strive to make live streaming seamless and visually appealing.
